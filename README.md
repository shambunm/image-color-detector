# image-color-detector
Color detector which identifies all the colors in an  image or video.
In this model a colour image is taken as input and similar colour are grouped together using the KMeans algorithm.
The grouping can be done based on the number of colour output we desire to get in this case 10.
The output is displyed with a piechart with percentage of the colour in the image and labeled as hexa colour values.
